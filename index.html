		<h2>ABOUT</h2>
		<p>Hello, my name is, Christopher Leveston, and I am a
			professional graphic designer, illustrator and I am
			currently learning web design. I am also founder of, LevestonDesigns,
		  a creative company based in Illinois. Please, take the time
			to view my work, from illustrations to logos, to drawings
			and paintings, I've done it all, and here, you can see it all.</p>

			<p>Born and raised in the South Suburbs of Chicago, Christopher as
			a kid enjoyed watching his favorite cartoons, especially when Saturday
		  mornings hit. During his junior high years, Christopher began his intense
		  journey on learning how to get better at his drawings. Here in junior high
		  he met others who drew and motivated him to get better at his skill.
		  during high school, it was set in stone to never give up his dream and take
		  art seriously and through to the very end. In high school, he taught himself
		  programming and design from as far as he could go. Christopher learned new things
		  relating to art and design and because of his technical personality,
		  he could not help but to learn about computers, and how they work, ultimatly
		  exposing him to the adobe creative suite applications.</p><br/>
			<p>During Christopher's first year in college, he began to study and research
			other artists and how they started their careers. From animators and cartoonists
		  to painters and programmers and web designers. One thing was common among
			all of them, and that was the fact that they all worked hard to get to where
			they needed to be, and this was no exception to Christopher.</p>
